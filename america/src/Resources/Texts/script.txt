--Start Again-- The year is 2015 you are a solution consultant for Guidewire Software working out of the Exton, PA office. One day whilst coding a PolicyCenter upgrade for a client you stumble across the secret for time travel! --start.png --Continue 
--Continue-- A few months after this discovery and you have managed to build a working time machine! Being the patriotic American that you are, you choose the American Revolution as your fist destination in history. But before you embark on your first adventure you should probably get something to eat, after all your mother always said “If you’re going to travel through time make sure you have something to eat first.” --time.jpg--Walk outside
--Walk outside-- Walking out of your lab in Philadelphia you see two nearby places that serve food. The first is a nice little French café that serves great quality food at a reasonable price, the second is a rundown McDonalds covered in offensive graffiti. You choose? --food.jpg --The French Café-The McDonalds 
--The French Café-- You choose the French café and after having a delicious and satisfying meal of nice meats, cheeses, fruits, and bread decide it’s time to head back to lab. --cafe.jpg --Head back 
--The McDonalds-- You choose the McDonalds believing that adventuring back to the birth of America should start with a truly American meal. After eating greasy meal of three Big Macs and two orders of fries you head back to lab. --mcd.jpg --Head back
--Head back -- Having eaten you are now ready for your adventure. You flip the switch on your time machine and with a great flash of light you are back in Colonial America. --woods.jpg --Continue...
--Continue...-- You find yourself standing near the bank of a large river, luckily for you in college you took a course on Pennsylvania river geography and know exactly where you are. You’re at the famous Washington’s Cross the place where George Washington crossed the Delaware River and invaded New Jersey from. Using your keen sense of eyesight you look around a spy an army encampment. What do you do? --cross.jpg --Start walking towards the army encampment. -Try to swim across the river. -Lay down and take a nap.
--Start walking towards the army encampment.-- You cautiously make your way towards the army encampment. Upon getting closer look you realize you seen hundreds of tents lined up near the bank of the river. Looking at the tents there is one tent that is significantly larger than the rest. Should you go into the large tent? --camp.jpg --Yes, head for the large tent. -No, look for a smaller tent.
--Try to swim across the river.-- Stepping to the shore you gaze across at the distant shore of New Jersey. Are you sure you want to do this? Its hundreds of feet wide and it’s the middle of winter. --water.jpg --Yes, it has always been my dream to swim across the Delaware in the middle of winter.
--Lay down and take a nap.-- You lie down and close your eyes. You are awoken by a hard jab to your ribs. You open your eyes and look up to find two soldiers standing over you. “Get up you’re coming with us.” Says one of the soldiers. They then drag you back towards the army encampment and chain you to a post inside one of the tents. You start to panic, what action should take. --field.jpg --Sit patiently and see what happens next. -Try to break free from the post you are tied to. 
--No, look for a smaller tent.-- You move quickly to one of the small tents careful to stay out of sight. Once inside find a man sitting with a rather shocked look on his face. He demands to know who you are. --tent.jpg --I am General Washington’s personal assistant, Andrew Jackson.  	 
--Yes, it has always been my dream to swim across the Delaware in the middle of winter.-- Jumping into the ice cold water you start to swim as hard as you can trying to keep your mind off the fact that this is exact same way your father died. Stroke after stroke sends you farther from the shore, the initial sting of the cold water has worn off and now your body is going numb. Moving your limbs becomes next to impossible, you turn around to see if it’s too late to turn back and find that it is. As you start to sink into the darkness of the river you can’t help but think, “Thanks, Obama” --deadWater.jpg --Start Again   
--I am General Washington’s personal assistant, Andrew Jackson.-- “O in that case would you care to join me for some tea?” says the man as he offers you a cup. -- --Slap the cup out of his hand and yell “Traitor! The only place tea belongs is in the Boston Harbor.” 
--Yes, head for the large tent.-- Oops you died!--dead.png --Start Again
